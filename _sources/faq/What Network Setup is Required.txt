What Network Setup is Required?
===============================

Q: Network setup required (do we need to have special router/switch configuration, do we need to allow jumbo packets etc.)?

We would like LLDP enabled on the switches for network topology discovery, but it is not required, otherwise no special requirements are needed beyond what is already required to run DHCP.
