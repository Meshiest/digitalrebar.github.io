Do you require specific networks?
=================================

Q: Is there a specific no. of networks that we need, e.g. a management network, a network for a dhcp range, production network etc.?

In a PoC bare-metal environment, the easiest thing would be to let us manage a block of IP addresses for bare-metal configuration purposes.  We have a system in-place for handling per-node network configuration and address management, but the documentation for it seems to have fallen out of the doc repo.  I will write up an outline of how are network management layer works.
